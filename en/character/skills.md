# Skills

Skills are the foundation of IdleMMO, allowing you to progress even when you're not playing.

#### How Skills Work

- The game includes numerous skills, from `Woodcutting` to `Mining`. 
- As you engage in a skill, materials are accumulated over time. For instance, with `Woodcutting`, you'll receive a [Log](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types) every few seconds, depending on the type of [Log](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types) being cut.
- You can step away from your device, and your character will keep working. When you come back, you'll find a collection of resources that were gathered while you were away.

**Note:** Some skills require specific [Equipment](/wiki/items-and-pets/equipment), like a [Pickaxe](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types) for `Mining`. You are given very basic equipment when you create your account but you can obtain better equipment by crafting them.

**Pro Tip:** Explore new locations to discover different items acquired from skills by [travelling](/wiki/activities-and-challenges/travelling).

### Types of Skills in IdleMMO

IdleMMO offers a variety of skills, each with its own unique progression. Some skills even level up passively and are integrated with other game mechanics.
