# Skills

Skills are the foundation of IdleMMO, allowing you to progress even when you're not playing.

#### How Skills Work

- The game includes numerous skills, from `Woodcutting` to `Mining`. 
- As you engage in a skill, materials are accumulated over time. For instance, with `Woodcutting`, you'll receive a [Log](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types?same_window=true) every few seconds, depending on the type of [Log](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types?same_window=true) being cut.
- You can step away from your device, and your character will keep working. When you come back, you'll find a collection of resources that were gathered while you were away.

>!banner Some skills require specific [Equipment](/wiki/items-and-pets/equipment?same_window=true), like a [Pickaxe](/wiki/items-and-pets/item-types?same_window=true) for `Mining`. You are given very basic equipment when you create your account but you can obtain better equipment by crafting them.

### Types of Skills in IdleMMO

IdleMMO offers a variety of skills, each with its own unique progression. Some skills even level up passively and are integrated with other game mechanics.

### Ascension Levels

Once a character hits the maximum level, they unlock `Ascension Levels`, starting at Ascension Level **1**.

- For every **1,000,000** experience points earned beyond level **100**, the character gains one Ascension Level. The journey continues up to a maximum of Ascension Level **500**.
- Characters an activate temporary passive perks that can increase skill efficiency, experience, and magic find for the related skill. The strength and duration of these perks vary based on the perk itself, and additional perks become available as the character advances through the ascension levels.

To activate a perk, you'll need **Ascension Points**, which work like a currency for activating the time-limited perks. 

- Each character can hold a maximum of **8** or **10** Ascension Points at a time depending on the characters membership status. This limit is fixed and cannot be increased.
- Only a maximum of **5** perks can be activated at a time. This limit is also fixed and cannot be increased.
- Ascension points replenish over time. An Ascension Point is given every **8 hours** for characters with membership, and **12 hours** without.
- Ascension Points are shared across all skills. For example, using a point on `Woodcutting` reduces the total points available for other skills like `Fishing` or `Mining`.

You can activate multiple perks simultaneously for a significant, short-lived boost. While this strategy can offer a lot of power, it comes with a cost - waiting for the regeneration of ascension points before activating perks again.

Ascension levels are only applicable to the following skills:
- Woodcutting
- Mining
- Fishing
- Alchemy
- Smelting
- Cooking
- Forge
- Hunting Mastery
- Combat
