# Classes

IdleMMO offers a variety of classes, each with unique effects and talents that enhance their performance in different tasks. Combat talents, which are stat boosts, are automatically granted as characters reach certain levels.

## Purpose of classes

The purpose of classes to is give players a choice in how they want to play the game. Each class has its own unique set of bonuses and talents that cater to different playstyles. For example, the `Warrior` class is focused on combat and physical strength, while the `Miner` class is focused on the `Mining` skill. Players can choose the class that best suits their preferred playstyle and goals in the game.

There are certain classes that are designed to be more challenging than others, such as the `Forsaken` class. These classes are intended for players who want a more difficult and challenging experience in the game. Players can choose these classes if they want to test their skills and push themselves to their limits.

## Changing Classes

Players can change their class  by purchasing the `Metamorphite` item from the [Merchants](/wiki/economy-and-trading/merchants?same_window=true) under General Goods. Once this item has been obtained, it can be used in the inventory.

However, please keep in mind that there are limits to the class changing system:
- The `Metamorphite` is a consumable item. A new item must be purchased every time a character wishes to change a class.
- A character is only able to chance their class once every **14 days**.
- Some classes are `locked` and cannot be changed. These classes are the `Forsaken`, `Cursed`, and `Banished`. This means a character cannot change to these classes or from these classes.
- The `Metamorphite` item cannot be traded between characters.

## Class Limitations

You can assign actions to up to three characters at a time if they have market access. However, characters without market access - such as those who are cursed or banished - are **not** subject to this limit. This exception exists because these characters cannot trade or impact the economy, preventing potential disruptions from multiple active alternate characters.

#### Example One
Imagine you have all five character slots filled: three warriors, one forsaken class, and one banished class.

In this case, you can set idle actions (e.g., woodcutting) for the three warriors. After this, you can still assign an action to the banished class since it doesn’t have market access. However, you **cannot** assign an action to the forsaken class, as it can access the market and your three slots for market-accessible characters are already used up.

#### Example Two
You have five characters: three warriors and two banished classes.

Here, you can assign idle actions to **all** characters. The three warriors use up your market-accessible slots, while the two banished characters aren't affected by the limit since they lack market access.

#### TLDR;
In short, you can only assign an idle action to three characters at a time. However, any class that **cannot** access the market or trade is **not** subject to this limit.
