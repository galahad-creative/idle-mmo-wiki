# Shooting Star

A shooting star is a special event that occurs randomly in the game. When a shooting star appears, active players in the game will be notified.

The goal is to search for the shooting star so that you can claim the timited-limited it offers. The boosts last for as long as the shooting star is active, which is typically around 30 to 60 minutes.
