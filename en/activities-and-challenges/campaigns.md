# Campaigns

Campaigns in IdleMMO provide a completely free, no strings attached battle pass experience, letting players earn various rewards like tokens and exclusive skins. There are two main types of campaigns to engage with:

#### Permanent Campaigns

- These are the main campaigns of IdleMMO, accessible at any time. They do not expire.
- Permanent campaigns offer a variety of rewards, including exclusive skins, tokens, and other in-game items.

>!!banner Don't worry about missing out! you can revisit any previous permanent campaign at your leisure.

#### Seasonal Campaigns

- These campaigns are tied to seasonal events like Halloween, Winter Holidays, Easter, and Valentine's Day, and they are available only for a limited time.
- Once a seasonal campaign ends, you cannot access it again.

**Features of Seasonal Campaigns:**
- They offer unique rewards and skills pertinent to the season.
- For instance, in the **Eve of Shadows** campaign, you can collect **Pumpkins** and exchange them for **Campaign Points** and rewards.
- These collectibles are acquired through skill-based activities, but first, your character must venture to the event-specific location, available only during the campaign.

>!banner Maximize your Campaign Points in the seasonal events by focusing on tasks that demand more attention. 

Building a **Snowman**, for instance, yields higher points compared to simple **Snowball** trading. This is by design, as activities requiring greater effort, like gathering materials for **Snowman**, are more rewarding in the campaign. Keep in mind, the extra effort pays off in a substantial points boost!

#### Community Goal

In every seasonal campaign, there’s a community goal that brings everyone together. Players work together to hit a shared target, and when the goal is reached, everyone is eligible for a boost. The boost lasts for the rest of the campaign. Once it ends, the boost expires.

For a character to receive a boost, they must contribute at least once to the community goal. Contributions only unlock the boost for the currently active tier and do not automatically apply to any future boosts if the community goal changes. As a result, if the goal changes, players will need to contribute again to access the new boost.

For example, if the community goal reaches tier 1 and you haven’t yet received any boost, you’ll need to contribute at least one point to unlock the tier 1 boost. Later, if the community goal advances to tier 2, you’ll need to contribute again to receive the tier 2 boost. If you don’t, your character will retain the tier 1 boost until it expires.

>!banner Unlike boosts provided by the shrine, the boosts from the <strong>community goal</strong> are not stackable. Any new boost from the <strong>community goal</strong> will replace the previous one, rather than adding to it.
