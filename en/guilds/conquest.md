# Conquest

Guilds can enhance their influence by participating in conquests. Guilds can launch **assaults** on various locations within the game. During an assault, any defeated enemy within the targeted location contributes experience points (EXP) to the guild and its progress.

>!banner A **Conquest Banner** component is needed to perform conquests.

>!banner Members participating in a conquest will earn Guild Mastery EXP.

### Guild Experience
Guild experience is calculated as a percentage of the total EXP a player earns from defeating enemies. The stronger the enemy, the more experience the guild receives.

#### Example:
- If a guild launches an assault on Bluebell Hollow, and a member defeats 1,200 scaled goblins, earning **150,000** EXP, the following rewards are applied:
    - The guild receives **7,500** EXP (5% of the player's EXP).
    - The conquest receives **7,500** EXP (5% of the player's EXP).
    - The player gains **7,500** Guild Mastery EXP (5% of the player's EXP).

#### Notes
- EXP is calculated individually for each enemy and always rounded down. Because of this, there may be times when the Guild Mastery EXP or Conquest EXP ends up slightly less than the expected 5%.
- The EXP your guild earns is also influenced by your character’s effects. So, if you’re using potions, buffs, or anything else that boosts your EXP gain, your guild will benefit too - both in regular guild EXP and conquest EXP.
- The minimum guild EXP earned during assaults is based on the enemy's EXP, unaffected by negative class effects (like Forsaken's -50% EXP penalty). For example, defeating a 50 EXP enemy guarantees at least 2 guild EXP (5% of 50 = 2.5, rounded down).

### Territory Control
Guild assaults are not just about experience – they also determine **territory control**. The guild with the most EXP in a location by the end of the season becomes its ruler for the following season, granting them exclusive boosts within that region*.

#### Example:
- If **Guild A** and **Guild B** are both competing for Bluebell Hollow, but **Guild A** secures more EXP, they will be crowned as the rules for the next season.
- Occupying guilds receive region-specific boosts for the duration of their rule.

#### Notes
- Guilds can assault multiple locations but can only launch one assault at a time.
- Assaults are performed in waves. Each wave takes **6 hours**. 
- Each assault costs **10 marks** to initiate.
- Poor planning, such as spreading forces too thin or wasting marks, could leave a guild unable to initiate future assaults.
- Only battles that start _after_ the assault is launched will count towards the guild's conquest.

>!banner Future updates may introduce **siege equipment** to enhance assaults. For example, Guilds might be able to construct trebuchets using materials from their stockpile.

#### Boosts

The winning guilds of the zone will receive the following boosts for the duration of their rule (the length of the subsequent season):

- **+10%** Primary Skill EXP
- **+3%** Primary Skill Efficiency
- **+2%** Dungeon Magic Find
- **+2%** World Boss Magic Find
- **+4%** Dungeon EXP
- **+5%** World Boss EXP
- **+5%** Hunting EXP

>!!banner There are currently technical limitations preventing the game from applying these boosts.  Our goal is to have it ready before Season 4 begins. If that happens, the winners of each zone from Season 3 will enjoy the full benefit of buffs throughout Season 4.<br/><br/> However, if the feature isn’t ready in time for the start of Season 4, we’ll release it during the season. In that case, the Season 3 winners will start getting the buffs from the moment the update goes live, and those buffs will last until the end of Season 4.
